Botani Scan Web Service is a cutting-edge platform that allows users to accurately predict plant diseases by simply uploading images of plant leaves. Currently, the service is undergoing development and is set to introduce new features in the near future. The initial release includes three key features: Pepper Leaf Disease Prediction, Tomato Leaf Disease Prediction, and Potato Leaf Disease Prediction.

To ensure secure access to the service, authentication is required. Users must log in using their email and password. If you are new to the platform, you can easily register through the registration service. We kindly request that you refrain from spamming the registration service to maintain its optimal performance.

We appreciate your cooperation and eagerly anticipate providing you with an enhanced experience as we continue to update and expand the service.

# Quick Look

# Authentications

This service utilizes token-based authentication, requiring users to have an account for accessing its features. If you don't have an account, please create a new one. Once registered, you can generate an authentication token. This token serves as a means of logging in, requiring you to authenticate yourself using your email and password. If the authentication is successful, you will receive an access token, enabling you to access the service. If the authentication fails, an error message will be displayed.

The provided tokens are the accessToken and refreshToken. The refreshToken is used for token refreshing purposes. The accessToken remains valid for one hour. To refresh the token, you must send the refreshToken to the service. If the refreshToken is valid, a new accessToken will be provided. If the refreshToken is invalid, an error message will be returned.

By following this authentication process, you can securely access the service and enjoy its functionalities.
